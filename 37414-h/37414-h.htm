<h2><span class="smcap">The Foolish Coat.</span></h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">The</span> Coat was in a downright rage.</div>

<p>"To be beaten, and caned, and cuffed,
and shaken, two or three times a-day,"
cried he, whisking his tails about like an
angry lion, "I say it's a shame."</p>

<p>"If you were not well thrashed," said the
Cane, "you'd soon get thick with dust,
and <i>then</i> I'd like to know how you'd look."</p>

<p>"So <i>I</i> say," remarked the Hat.</p>

<p>"It's all very well for you to talk, Mr.
Cane," said the Coat, still more in a rage.
"Nobody ever hits you, and if they did,
you could hit back. And as for you, Mr.
Hat, nobody ever thinks of punching you,
except in fun. You have a nice soft
brush all to yourself."</p>

<p>"Well, are you not brushed as well?"
asked the Hat.</p>

<p>"I don't mind being brushed," said the
Coat, "but the next time Mr. Valet comes
along, and hits me, I'll&mdash;I'll&mdash;" then he
growled something to himself, whisked
his tails, and added, "<i>See</i> if I don't."</p>

<p>In came the Valet, and bustled about.
The Coat eyed him, and when he came
close, caught him up with <i>such</i> a clutch.</p>

<p>"Hallo, hallo, hallo!" cried the Valet.
"What are you doing?"</p>

<p>But the Coat hung the Valet on a
nail, and snatched up the Cane.</p>

<p>"Now, look here, Mister Valet," said
he. "I'm not going to be dusted and
beaten and thumped. I'm just going to
show you what it feels like, Mister Valet."</p>

<p>"What are you talking about, you
stupid old Coat?" said the Valet.</p>

<p>"I'll let you see," said the Coat, flourishing
the Cane.</p>

<p>The Cane could not help himself, for
he was thin.</p>

<p>Thump, thump, thump, went the Coat,
blowing out such clouds and clouds of
dust from the Valet's clothes, never
remembering he was covering himself
with dust, and making himself look
shockingly shabby. The Valet called out
as loud as he could for help, but nobody
heard him, and the Coat kept on thumping
till his sleeves fairly ached. Then he
dropped the Cane, fell on the dirty floor,
and whisked his tails with great satisfaction.</p>

<p>The Cane jumped up, and lifted down
the Valet, who went off to his own room.</p>

<p>A few days after, the master came in,
and looked at the Coat, which he had
meant to wear at a jolly garden party.</p>

<p>"Oh," said he, "how dreadfully shabby
that Coat looks."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said the Valet, "he won't
allow himself to be brushed or dusted."</p>

<p>"Oh, won't he?" said the Master,
"that's all very fine, but it won't do for me."
So he seized the Cane, and gave the Coat
one good thump. But such a cloud of
dust came out of the Coat that the Master
threw down the Cane, and ran to the door.</p>

<p>"Oh," cried he, "I can't wear that
frightful old thing any more. It is
disgracefully shabby and dusty. Sell it
to the first 'ole clo'' man that comes
along." But he took the Hat, and went
to the nice party.</p>

<p>And what do you think became of
this foolish Coat? Why, he was hung on
a stick in a field to make a scare-crow.
And serve him right, a stupid thing.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Alf and the Parrot.</span></h2>


<div class='poem'>
The old Poll Parrot was in a rage;<br />
He bounced and spluttered about in his cage.<br />
<br />
The reason he felt so much displeased<br />
Was because young Alf had worried and teased.<br />
<br />
He pecked, and bobbed, and knocked with his beak,<br />
Too much enraged to be able to speak.<br />
<br />
To tease him was a scandalous shame:<br />
Alf was a bad boy, and much to blame.<br />
<br />
"I tell you, young Alf," at last Poll said,<br />
"If you don't leave off, I'll snap off your head.<br />
<br />
"You think you're allowed to tease a bird.<br />
Now, that idea's extremely absurd.<br />
<br />
"One thing, young Alf, is certain and sure&mdash;<br />
Your worry and bother no more I'll endure.<br />
<br />
"Another thing, Alf, is also clear:<br />
I mean to walk out, and lock you in here."<br />
<br />
Poor Alfy screamed and bawled with rage<br />
When Poll marched out, and put <i>him</i> in the cage!<br />
<br />
Cried Alf, "I think this horrible bird<br />
Is going to be as good as his word."<br />
<br />
Laughed old Poll, as he perched on a chair,<br />
"You thought to punish you I'd never dare.<br />
<br />
"You may bawl or howl, or scream and rage&mdash;<br />
I'm going to lock the door of the cage!"<br />
<br />
Alfy did cry out&mdash;Oh! didn't he shout,<br />
When he found the Parrot would not let him out!<br />
<br />
Said Poll, "My dear boy, it's now <i>our</i> turn;<br />
The world's upside down, as you have to learn."<br />
<br />
So Alf was forced to make up his mind<br />
In the cage of the Parrot to be confined.<br />

<h2><span class="smcap">The Clever Hare.</span></h2>


<div class='unindent'>"<span class="smcap">To</span> be hunted, and trapped, and watched
for by night, and&mdash;and&mdash;I don't know
what, is most abominable!" said the Hare.</div>

<p>Some dogs had frightened him, and he
had run&mdash;run like a hare, in fact, and then
sat down upon his form to think. The
dogs had not stood upon ceremony, so he
didn't choose to stand upon forms, but sat
down comfortably.</p>

<p>He twitched his ears, and scratched his
wig, and thought.</p>

<p>"And I won't put up with it&mdash;<i>there</i>,"
said he, aloud. "It's only cowardice
putting up with things. I'll get some
fellows to help me, and we'll hunt the
dogs."</p>

<p>At that moment he heard a sound.</p>

<p>"Wow! bow, wow, wow!" barked
some dog, a little way off.</p>

<p>The Hare jumped up again, and flew
off as quick as his legs would carry him.
After running some distance, he sat down
again, but this time he found neither forms
nor ceremonies.</p>

<p>But he found something that was better.
A gun and a sportsman's bag were lying
near, and he eyed them.</p>

<p>"I wonder if that gun would go off if I
touched it!" he said to himself.</p>

<p>He walked round and round it, and
then cautiously pawed it. No: it
didn't seem to have the least idea of
going off.</p>

<p>Then he lifted it up, and grew quite
bold.</p>

<p>"I wonder if I could shoot anything?"
thought he.</p>

<p>He aimed at a bird, and brought it
down.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 375px;">
<img src="images/illus_015.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="Hare shooting a rifle" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Bravo, bravo, bravo!" cried he. "I'll
take this gun, and then if anybody tries to
torment or to catch me, I'll&mdash;I'll kill them."</p>

<p>He hung the bag round his waist, and
put the gun on his shoulder, then walked
off to his home. On the way, a boy ran
at him, and cried "Bo!" but he just
pointed the gun, and the boy ran away.</p>

<p>The Hare lived all by himself, but he
was very comfortable. Nobody could
bother him, and he would have been quite
content only for the men and the dogs.</p>

<p>Every day he practised with his gun till
he got to be very skilful.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Just let them come along<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And they shall all soon see,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">That they're all in the wrong</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">To plague and bother me.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Although I'm but a hare,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">I think I'm very smart,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And can&mdash;let them beware&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Right well take my own part."</span><br />
</div>

<p>So he sang, as he sat one day polishing
up his gun.</p>

<p>As he was busily at work, he heard a
noise, and cocked his ear. Tramp, tramp,
tramp, came along some one&mdash;a man.
It was a poacher, who said to himself he
was going to catch a fine fat Hare. The
man cast an eye round, but the Hare hid,
and watched.</p>

<p>Then the man stole nearer, and peeped
round a tree.</p>

<p>"Aha!" said the Hare. "You want
to catch me, and eat me, don't you? But
I am going to catch you, and boil you for
my supper."</p>

<p>The man only laughed, for it was preposterous
the idea of a Hare catching a
man, instead of a man catching a hare.</p>

<p>And the Hare just cocked his gun, put
it to his shoulder, and fired. Then he
did kill the poacher, and took him home,
and stewed him with mushrooms for
supper.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">the</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Strong Man and the Invalid</span></h2>


<div class='unindent'>"<span class="smcap">Where's</span> the good of going on grumble,
grumble, grumble, all the day long?" said
the strong Man to the Invalid. "Why,
you get petted and have extra nice things
to eat, beautiful bunches of grapes, and
boiled chickens, and I don't know what."</div>

<p>"If you were <i>me</i>, you would not talk
like that," said the Invalid, in a poor sick
weak voice. "I'd eat dry bread, and never
ask to be petted at all if I were strong,
like you."</p>

<p>The Strong Man laughed, as if he
didn't believe the Invalid.</p>

<p>"I have to work hard all day, and nobody
seems to care a bit whether I'm tired
or not," said he. "But if you only have a
finger ache, everybody is running about
trying to find something to do you good.
And they come and read to you, and
bring you flowers, and&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You just take my place for a day or
two, and see how you'd like it," said the
Invalid.</p>

<p>"Um&mdash;well, I shouldn't like to be ill,
you know," said the Strong Man. "I
shouldn't like to lie in bed, nor have the
doctor coming to see me, because he'd
give me nasty stuff to take."</p>

<p>"I'll be your doctor," said the Invalid.
"But you must lie in bed. Come, take
my place."</p>

<p>The Strong Man was ashamed to
refuse.</p>

<p>"Well, now you are comfortable, I
suppose," said the Invalid, tucking him in.
"You must try to doze a little."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 365px;">
<img src="images/illus_020.jpg" width="365" height="500" alt="Lith. Emrik &amp; Binger, Haarlem." title="" />
</div>

<p>"But I'm not sleepy," said the Strong
Man.</p>

<p>"You'll soon be tired, and go to sleep,"
said the Invalid. "I'm going away, but
shall be back in an hour or two."</p>

<p>When he went away, the place seemed
dreadfully dull. Not a sound was to be
heard except the barking of a dog in a
farm-yard near, and the cluck cluck of
some hens.</p>

<p>"Dear, dear," said the Strong Man,
"this is very tiresome."</p>

<p>Presently an old lady looked in.</p>

<p>"Poor dear, poor dear," said she, "I
will read a nice book to you."</p>

<p>So she sat down and read out of a book.
But the Strong Man didn't care about the
book, and he thought the old lady stupid.</p>

<p>Then she went away, and by-and-by,
a kind old gentleman came in with some
chicken, and a glass of wine, and some
beautiful white bread.</p>

<p>"Here," said he, "Take this, it will
do you good."</p>

<p>But the Strong Man didn't feel hungry,
and he was tired and cross by this time,
so he wouldn't have any of it. Then some
more people came in, and talked to him,
and told him the Invalid had gone to see
the reapers, and tried to be kind to him.
Then at last everybody stole away on
tiptoe, and left him alone.</p>

<p>Then the Invalid came back. But by
that time the Strong Man had had quite
enough of being shut up in a sick room, so
he jumped up, and ran to the door.</p>

<p>"I see you are not much to be envied,"
said he to the Invalid. "I don't think I
shall ever envy anybody again so long
as I have health and strength."</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">The Kite's Little Game</span></h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">The</span> Kite laughed and chuckled to
himself until his paper fairly crackled.</div>

<p>"We shall have such a game," said he
to his paper Tails.</p>

<p>"We mostly do," squeaked the Tails.</p>

<p>There were eighteen of them, and they
were all very frisky.</p>

<p>The Kite first winked one eye, then
the other, then winked both together.</p>

<p>I'm afraid he was rather a vulgar sort of
a Kite, but he was very jolly. His eyes
were inclined to be goggly, yellow round
the outside, with red in the middle. He
was not a particularly good-looking Kite&mdash;in
fact, he was really ugly&mdash;but he
was very funny, and loved a joke.</p>

<p>The string suddenly wakened up out of
a nap, hearing talk going on, "Eh, what's
that?" said he.</p>

<p>"Don't know," said the Tails.</p>

<p>The Kite laughed again, and shook his
round ears, and showed all his teeth in
one wide grin. "We'll have a game this
afternoon," said he, once more.</p>

<p>"Oh," said the String. "We mostly do."</p>

<p>The Kite stuck up his pointed chin, and
shook his red paper beard. "I mean a
different sort of game to what <i>you</i> mean,"
said he. "You mean, we have a game when
young Walter takes us out. But I don't
mean <i>that</i>."</p>

<p>"Then what <i>do</i> you mean?" said the
String, who didn't care about guessing.</p>

<p>"When he takes us out, we have to
go where <i>he</i> likes, and fly when he chooses
us to fly," said the Kite. "Now <i>I</i> mean,
we'll fly young Walter."</p>

<p>"Eh?" said the String.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 379px;">
<img src="images/illus_025.jpg" width="379" height="500" alt="Kite flying a boy" title="" />
</div>

<p>The String was rather sleepy-headed,
and didn't take in new ideas very quickly.
He was so astonished now that he unrolled
himself several yards, and wriggled about
round the Kite, to look at him, as if he
must be out of his mind.</p>

<p>"Eh?" said all the Tails, after a flutter
of surprise. But they thought it was a
joke, and that the Kite only meant to be
funny. The Kite straightened himself,
and looked very important. "When I
say a thing, I mean it," said he, in a
dignified manner.</p>

<p>"Well, but&mdash;" said one Tail, timidly.</p>

<p>"<i>Well</i>, but what?" snapped the Kite.
"You don't know what you're talking
about. I say we'll fly&mdash;"</p>

<p>At that minute up came Walter. He
took hold of the Kite, and was winding
up the String, when the Kite said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Master Walter, let's fly <i>you</i> to day!"</p>

<p>Walter stared and laughed.</p>

<p>"You couldn't," said he. "You're only
made of paper."</p>

<p>"Let us try," said the Kite.</p>

<p>"I mustn't go far, then," said Walter,
"because my mother would wonder where
I was."</p>

<p>So the String was tied about Walter,
and up he flew. It was very jolly, and he
flew here and there like a bird. The Kite
and the String were delighted, and the
Tails kept on a chatter, chatter, chatter,
like eighteen little magpies all in a row.
But the Kite found it hard work after a
time. He had to mind the string, and
watch lest Walter should tumble down, and
keep on doing this and doing that, instead
of pleasantly fluttering about. He got
cross and grumpy at last. "I think the
old way's the best," said he. "Next time
I'll go up. Old ways are best, after all."</p>

I think you will own<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That it is very rare</span><br />
To see fishes and frogs<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sail about in the air,</span><br />
<br />
While the birds and the poultry<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are swimming about</span><br />
Like so many mackerel<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or pikes, sprats, or trout,</span><br />
<br />
In old times, the fishes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And birds, were content</span><br />
To remain all their lives<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In their <i>own</i> element.</span><br />
<br />
Things are different now:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They have changed the old times,</span><br />
Turned the world topsy-turvy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With no reasons or rhymes.</span><br />
<br />
But I think you'll agree<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It is simply absurd</span><br />
For a fish to pretend<br />

<h2><span class="smcap">The Wonderful Show.</span></h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">One</span> fine summer's afternoon, the Lion
went trotting home in high good humour.
As he went along, he kept muttering and
grinning to himself, as if mightily pleased.
When he got home, he banged at the door
of his den with his tail. A Lion's tail is
very strong and hard, you know, stronger
and harder than any bell rope. The
Lioness, his wife, was out at the back,
combing out the manes of her young
Lions, but presently she came and opened
the door.</div>

<p>"My dear," cried the Lion, "<i>such</i> a
piece of news!"</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed?" said the Lioness.
"Have you found some travellers to eat?"</p>

<p>"Better than <i>that</i>," said the Lion, all
a-glow, rubbing his paws.</p>

<p>"Oh, in-<i>deed</i>," said the Lioness, smiling.
"Then it must be very good indeed."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Lion. "Just guess, my
love."</p>

<p>"How <i>can</i> I guess? I never was good
at guessing. Besides, you could tell me
quicker than I could guess," said the
Lion's wife.</p>

<p>"How clever you are," said the Lion,
putting his tawny head on one side, and
looking admiringly at his queen. "Perhaps
telling <i>is</i> the quickest way after all.
Well&mdash;" Then he stopped, as if to tantalize.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;what? How tiresome you are,"
said the Lioness.</p>

<p>"They have brought a cageful of humans
to the town, and all the Beasts and all the
Birds are going to see the show."</p>

<p>"<i>What!</i>" cried the Lioness, so astonished
that she could hardly believe her ears.</p>

<p>The Lion skipped right round the
parlour three times, snapping his claws like
castanets. "Yes," said he, gleefully, "they
used to lock <i>us</i> up, and let people pay to see
us, and call us Wild Beasts, and Carnivora,
and all sorts of ugly names. But times are
changed. I wonder how they'll like it?
We'll take our little beasts of children to
see the show."</p>

<p>"You <i>shouldn't</i> call the little ducks
Beasts," said the Lioness. "I wonder you
don't call them a parcel of Cubs."</p>

<p>"Well, they <i>are</i> Beasts and Cubs, ain't
they?" said the Lion.</p>

<p>"Well, never mind, I won't have them
spoken of like that," said his wife. "When
will you take me and the darling pets to
see this wonderful show?"</p>

<p>"Come now," said the Lion, jingling
his money in the purse he carried in the
end of his tail.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm not dressed," said the Lioness.</p>

<p>"You never are," said the Lion.</p>

<p>"That's true," said his wife. "Well,
here! children! come along and see the
Tame Humans."</p>

<p>The young cubs came rolling in, all
tumbling over one another, like jolly little
brutes as they were, and set up a wild roar
of delight at hearing they were going out
for the day. When they got half way, the
Lion suddenly stopped and considered.</p>

<p>"I think," said he, "as we are going to
change places with the humans, we ought
to have all the fine things they used to
have, so we'll buy some clothes."</p>

<p>"All right, my dear," said the Lioness.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 368px;">
<img src="images/illus_035.jpg" width="368" height="500" alt="People in the zoo" title="" />
</div>

<p>So they went into a shop, which they
found belonged to a very civil elephant.
They were quickly fitted out with nice
suits, and then trotted contentedly on. A
large crowd of beasts and birds was going
the same way, and at the door it was hard
to get in. The greatest excitement prevailed&mdash;which
means, you know, that
people&mdash;animals, I mean&mdash;were laughing
and talking, and wondering, and squeezing,
and pushing, and treading on one another's
toes, and saying "Where are you shoving
to?" and "There's plenty of room," and
"Don't be disagreeable," and "Don't lose
your temper, pray," and asking questions,
and all that kind of thing. The Lion and
his wife were afraid to take in the children,
so left them outside with an old Cow, who
was herself <ins title="Transcriber's Note: This word not present in original text">too</ins> frightened to venture, and too
fat to squeeze through the throng. Inside,
the animals were all staring their hardest.
The humans in the cages didn't at all
relish being shown, and were very cross.
A Wolf with a long stick was telling about
all their ways, and poking them up to make
them roar. One young man in a blue
coat howled with rage, until a good-natured
old Rhinoceros, with a red shawl,
threw him a bun. He was so ungrateful as
to kick it out of his cage, which offended
the old Rhinoceros, as you may imagine.</p>

<p>"Times are changed, ain't they?" said
a jolly old Bear to the Lion, chuckling.</p>

<p>"Quite time too," answered the Lion.</p>

<p>The Ostrich craned his long neck, and
stared as hard as he could, as did all the
animals. The Lioness was very well
pleased, but she hurried out to see after
her children, while the Lion stayed to have
a good look. In fact, there never had been
such a sight seen in Beastland before, and
I don't suppose there ever will be such a
one again.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">The Unkind Trees.</span></h2>


<div class='unindent'>"<span class="smcap">You</span> know it's ridiculous, and we
mustn't put up with it any longer," said
the Plane Tree. He wasn't called the
Plane Tree because he was not good looking,
but because he always spoke his mind.</div>

<p>"That's what <i>I</i> say," grumbled the Elm.</p>

<p>"To be sure," cried the Oak, in a deep,
deep, deep voice&mdash;you would have fancied
it came out of his boots. But I forgot:
of course Oaks don't wear boots&mdash;but that
does not signify.</p>

<p>The Aspen and the Sycamore sighed,
and shook their leaves, and looked wise.</p>

<p>The <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Chesnut'">Chestnut</ins> and the Beech whispered
to one another, and waved their boughs
indignantly.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Poplar, a tall, straight,
stiff tree, with a squeaky voice, "I <i>do</i>
think it's a shame the Wood-cutters should
be allowed to come here and cut us up
whenever they choose. The Government,
or the Parish, or the Local Authorities,
or&mdash;or&mdash;<i>somebody</i>, ought to hinder them."</p>

<p>"Everybody encourages them to do it,"
said the Box Tree, angrily. The Box
Tree was rather fond of fighting, and that's
how he came by his name.</p>

<p>"I know what we ought to do," said
the Birch, "Whip them."</p>

<p>"Chop them up," cried the Plane Tree,
who was fond of carpentry.</p>

<p>The trees all fluttered their leaves.
They were rather frightened at the ideas
of the Birch and Plane.</p>

<p>"Well," growled the Oak. But he
couldn't think of anything to say, so was
obliged to stop.</p>

<p>The Ivy had not said a word, but
listened to everything. Now she lifted up
her head, and spoke&mdash;so softly that it
seemed as if the summer wind was rustling
through her leaves.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 372px;">
<img src="images/illus_040.png" width="372" height="500" alt="Man on sawhorses" title="" />
</div>

<p>"I think," said the gentle Ivy&mdash;and
though she spoke so sweetly, her voice
could be heard by every tree&mdash;"I think
when there are so many branches to spare,
and when it is an improvement to the
trees to be lopped and pruned a little bit,
it is foolish to object. And when we know
the poor wood-cutters make their living by
cutting wood in the forest, and when poor
children are often shivering in the winter
for want of fire, it is selfish to grumble
about a few fagots of wood."</p>

<p>There was a deep stillness. Not a
word did any tree speak, till the Elm said,
with a bit of a sneer, "Ivy does not know
what she is talking about."</p>

<p>"She means well," said the Cedar, "but
she does talk nonsense." "So she does,"
murmured some other trees.</p>

<p>Ivy hung her head, and heard with
grief and displeasure that the very next
wood-cutter who came through the forest
should be chopped up, as an example. In
the afternoon, Hans came along, singing
gaily to himself. He looked about, and
noticed some branches that might be cut
off without spoiling the trees, for he loved
the trees, and would not have hurt them
for the world. But as he laid down his
saw on his wooden horse, it was snatched
by the Birch with its long arms, and he
felt himself whipped up.</p>

<p>"Oh, oh, oh," cried Hans.</p>

<p>"Ho, ho, ho," cried the trees, maliciously.</p>

<p>Ivy covered herself with her own leaves,
for she could <ins title="Transcriber's Note: This word not present in original text">not</ins> bear to see so sad a sight,
and she cried. So Hans was cut up, and
his poor children had nobody to earn any
money to buy them food, for their mother
was dead. And the wood-cutters were
afraid to come near the forest, lest they
should be served like Hans. And what
happened? Why, there was nobody to
prune the trees, and they grew so thick
that their branches all got entangled and
twisted, and they smothered one another.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest

status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United

SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
